                    In the Prologue, an unnamed maid worries about being arrested after a body is found in the house where she works. The story behind this incident begins as Wilhelmina “Millie” Calloway interviews for a job as a live-in housekeeper for Nina Winchester, a rich, middle-aged woman. Despite her criminal record, she gets the job and moves into the mansion. She’s given a tiny room in the attic that only locks from the outside and has a window that doesn’t open. Unnerved, Millie requests a key, which Nina gives her along with a new phone.

                    The landscaper, Enzo, warns her of danger but won’t elaborate. She meets Nina’s handsome husband, Andrew, and her nine-year-old daughter, Cecelia. Millie spends hours cleaning the filthy house before fixing dinner. Andrew compliments her cooking and invites her to join them, but she declines, as Nina seems irritated. During the night, when Millie wakes to use the bathroom, the doorknob sticks, and she starts to panic; she gets the door open but has a sense of foreboding.
