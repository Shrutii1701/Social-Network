                Baby Teeth by Zoje Stage is a crazy psychological thriller about the most dysfunctional
                 relationship between a mother and a child ever. The plot will get compared to The Omen,
                  the Richard Donner film from the 1970’s, but where that plot involved a supernatural presence 
                  this book does not which makes it a little scarier. The writing in Baby Teeth is really great
                   with a lot of really clever metaphors and passages. The pace of the book is really fast and very
                    hard to put down. The theme and meaning running through the book is selfishness which all main 
                    characters have and is manifested in different ways: selfishness in career, selfishness in
                     alone time, and selfishness of love. You could make arguments for which character was the most
                      selfish. The psychological aspect of the book is done really well and is explained that even 
                      this C student in Psychology can understand. Hanna is a 7 year-old mute and a big part of the
                       book relies on reading her gestures, which are described so well. I was never lost on what
                        she was trying to convey. The ending was a little underwhelming I think it worked for the
                         story but I was left wanting a little more. This story is crazy in a good way and goes to
                          shocking places. Baby Teeth is no holds barred in its’ brutality but it works and seems
                           plausible in the narrative that Zoje Stage has set up. I can totally see the character
                            of Suzette on the am I the asshole reddit forum for what Hanna is doing to her. I think 
                            this book would be an interesting study for a Psychology class discussion. Baby Teeth
                             was published by St. Martin’s Press in August 9 2018.

                             Hanna is 7 and a mute by choice which would drive any parent a little crazy. Suzette 
                             is the mom that is losing her identity and having a hard time connecting to her 
                             daughter. She worries more about failing as a parent then connecting with her child,
                              but Hanna doesn’t make it easy. Hanna thinks her mom is her mortal enemy and in 
                              competition for her daddy’s love. There is no sharing his love in her eyes; she
                               needs it all. The only way she can achieve that is by removing her mother by any 
                               means necessary. Hanna’s dad is totally oblivious to all of this, as he is focused
                                on his career and likes being a part-time dad. Hanna imagines herself in a fairy 
                                tale that must kill her evil mother to gain the love of her father. This book is crazy and this summary just scratches the surface of the plot for this book.
