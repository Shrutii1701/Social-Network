                This plot is presented in chronological order. During the American Revolution, a group of Rebels, 
                hiding beneath the future Keyhouse, discover a portal to another dimension, the plains of Leng, 
                filled with demons who can mesmerize anyone that sees them and possess them through touch. However,
                 when the demons attempt to enter the real world, they are transformed into "whispering" iron which
                  young smith Benjamin Locke forges into a variety of magical keys, including the Omega Key, which 
                  seals the entrance to the dimension. The magic of the Keyhouse gradually evolves over the years,
                   including a spell which causes occupants to forget about the keys and the magic of the house 
                   when they pass their 18th birthday. In 1988, a group of teenagers, having used the keys 
                   extensively in their high school years to their great delight, decide to open the black door 
                   with the Omega Key, hoping to trick a demon into entering the real world in order to provide 
                   more metal with which to make more keys. Rendell Locke's younger brother follows the group and 
                   is mesmerized by the door and when attempting to walk through it, he is stopped by Dodge who 
                   accidentally puts his hand through the door, becoming possessed by a demonic being. After 
                   plotting and attempting to kill his friends and enslave the others at the behest of the Child of 
                   Leng possessing him, Dodge is killed by Rendell.
                   <br>
                   Many years later, Dodge's spirit re-enters the physical world through the well at Keyhouse, due
                    to actions taken by Dodge prior to his death. Trapped in the well, Dodge's spirit reaches out 
                    to a young abused prodigy, Sam Lesser, and convinces him to attack the Lockes and kill Rendell
